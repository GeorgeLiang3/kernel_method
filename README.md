# kernel_method
kernel method developed for gravity simulation based on Implicit modeling (GemPy)

The code is developed based on older version of GemPy (https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy.git) and the TensorFlow extension GemPyTF (https://github.com/GeorgeLiang3/GemPyTF.git). ([GP_old](https://github.com/GeorgeLiang3/kernel_method/tree/main/GP_old)) 

The code (in [NoteBooks](kernel_method/NoteBooks) is used to prepare the submmited manuscript to Geophysics.

To run the code, ones need to update the sys.path with their own path. The best practice is to use Google Colab.
