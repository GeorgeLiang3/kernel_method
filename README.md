# kernel_method
kernel method developed for gravity simulation based on Implicit modeling (GemPy)

The source code ([GP_old](/GP_old)) is developed based on older version of GemPy (https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy.git) and the TensorFlow extension GemPyTF (https://github.com/GeorgeLiang3/GemPyTF.git). 

The notebooks (in [NoteBooks](/NoteBooks) are used to prepare the submmited manuscript to Geophysics. The functions will be integrated to GemPyTF package in the furure.

To run the code, ones need to update the sys.path with their own path. The best practice is to use Google Colab.
